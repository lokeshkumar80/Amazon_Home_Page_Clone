# Amazon-CLone-Webpage

This project is a clone of the Amazon home page, developed to strengthen my front-end web development skills. It has been both a challenging and rewarding experience, and I’ve gained significant hands-on learning throughout the process.

# Learning Journey
During the development phase, I encountered several challenges — from layout structuring to responsive design. I overcame these obstacles by referring to online resources, particularly YouTube tutorials. I would especially like to thank Shraddha Khapra ma'am, whose clear and practical teaching style made the learning process engaging and effective.

# Project Details
Rather than creating a standard landing page, I chose to replicate the Amazon home page. This decision allowed me to explore real-world design principles, improve my understanding of component-based architecture, and gain deeper insights into how large-scale websites are structured.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Shraddha Khapra ma'am, for her exceptional guidance and support throughout the journey.

# Conclusion
Creating this Amazon clone webpage has been a valuable learning experience that significantly enhanced my web development capabilities. I'm proud of the outcome and look forward to applying these skills to more complex and creative projects in the future.

Thank you, Shraddha Khapra ma'am, for the incredible learning experience!
